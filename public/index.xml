      <description>Hi! I&amp;rsquo;m Nicholas. I&amp;rsquo;m a Software Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. I have experience in frontend and backend development from my time working at Rivalry and on projects such as SharpChat and RadomirChess. Aside from school, I spend my time making origami and playing piano which have been long-standing passions of mine. I enjoy meeting new people and hope one day I can travel to Switzerland.
I&amp;rsquo;m currently looking for Summer 2023 internship opportunities.</description>
