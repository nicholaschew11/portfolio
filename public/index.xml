      <description>Hi! I&amp;rsquo;m Nicholas. I&amp;rsquo;m a Software Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. I have experience in frontend and backend development from my time working at Rivalry. I have also worked on projects such as a multiplayer chess app, messaging web app, and wearable glasses that assist in playing blackjack. Aside from school, I spend my time making origami and playing piano which have been long-standing passions of mine. I enjoy spending time with friends and hope one day I can travel to Switzerland.</description>
