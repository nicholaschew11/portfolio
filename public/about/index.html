 I have also worked on projects such as a <a href="https://github.com/nicholaschew11/sharpchat" target="_blank">messaging web app</a>
, a <a href="https://github.com/nicholaschew11/Radomir-Chess" target="_blank">multiplayer chess app</a>
, and <a href="https://github.com/nicholaschew11/BlackjackVision" target="_blank">wearable glasses that assist in playing blackjack.</a>
</p>
<p>Aside from school, I spend my time making origami and playing piano which have been long-standing passions of mine. I enjoy spending time with friends and hope one day I can travel to Switzerland.</p>
