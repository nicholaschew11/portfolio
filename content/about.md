## Hi! I'm Nicholas.

I'm a Software Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. I have experience in frontend and backend development from my time working at [Rivalry.](https://rivalry.com) I have also worked on projects such as a [multiplayer chess app,](https://github.com/nicholaschew11/Radomir-Chess) [messaging web app,](https://github.com/nicholaschew11/sharpchat) and [wearable glasses that assist in playing blackjack.](https://github.com/nicholaschew11/BlackjackVision)

Aside from school, I spend my time making origami and playing piano which have been long-standing passions of mine. I enjoy spending time with friends and hope one day I can travel to Switzerland.
