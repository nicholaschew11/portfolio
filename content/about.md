## Hi! I'm Nicholas.

I'm a Software Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. I have experience in frontend and backend development from my time working at [Rivalry](https://rivalry.com) and on projects such as [SharpChat](https://github.com/nicholaschew11/sharpchat) and [RadomirChess.](https://github.com/nicholaschew11/Radomir-Chess)

Aside from school, I spend my time making origami and playing piano which have been long-standing passions of mine. I enjoy meeting new people and hope one day I can travel to Switzerland.

I'm currently looking for Summer 2023 internship opportunities. [Feel free to reach out!](mailto:nicholas.chew@uwaterloo.ca)
